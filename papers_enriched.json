    "abstract": "Background:\n              Vaccines against viruses have been proposed as a novel means to reduce antibiotic use, which would, in turn, decrease selection for antibiotic resistant bacteria. However, the impact of this intervention is poorly quantified, and likely depends on setting-specific epidemiology. Therefore, with increasing confidence in a new vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), it is important to quantify the impact of these vaccines on antibiotic prescribing and any downstream reduction in drug resistant bacterial infections.\n            \n            \n              Methods:\n              Here we integrate results from a dynamic transmission model of RSV and a statistical attribution framework to capture the impact of RSV vaccines on the reduction in antibiotic prescribing due to averted primary care visits in England.\n            \n            \n              Results:\n              Under base case assumptions, we find that the most impactful RSV vaccine strategy targets children aged 5–14 years, resulting in an annual reduction of 10.9 (8.0–14.2) antibiotic courses per 10,000 person years across the entire population, equivalent to reducing annual all-cause primary care prescribing by 0.23%. Our results suggest that this reduction in antibiotic use would gain 130 disability-adjusted life years and avert £51,000 associated with drug resistant bacterial infections. Seasonally administering monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to high-risk infants under 6 months is the most efficient strategy, reducing per person year antibiotic prescribing by 2.6 (1.9–3.3) antibiotic courses per 1,000 mAb courses.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions:\n              Under optimistic conditions, the cost-effectiveness of RSV vaccine strategies in England would likely not be altered by integrating the benefits of preventing drug resistant infections in addition to RSV disease prevention.",

    "abstract": "Background\n              : Mobility restrictions prevent the spread of infections to disease-free areas, and early in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, most countries imposed severe restrictions on mobility as soon as it was clear that containment of local outbreaks was insufficient to control spread. These restrictions have adverse impacts on the economy and other aspects of human health, and it is important to quantify their impact for evaluating their future value.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              : Here we develop Scotland Coronavirus transmission Model (SCoVMod), a model for COVID-19 in Scotland, which presents unusual challenges because of its diverse geography and population conditions. Our fitted model captures spatio-temporal patterns of mortality in the first phase of the epidemic to a fine geographical scale.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              : We find that lockdown restrictions reduced transmission rates down to an estimated 12\\% of its pre-lockdown rate. We show that, while the timing of COVID-19 restrictions influences the role of the transmission rate on the number of COVID-related deaths, early reduction in long distance movements does not. However, poor health associated with deprivation has a considerable association with mortality; the Council Area (CA) with the greatest health-related deprivation was found to have a mortality rate 2.45 times greater than the CA with the lowest health-related deprivation considering all deaths occurring outside of carehomes.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              : We find that in even an early epidemic with poor case ascertainment, a useful spatially explicit model can be fit with meaningful parameters based on the spatio-temporal distribution of death counts. Our simple approach is useful to strategically examine trade-offs between travel related restrictions and physical distancing, and the effect of deprivation-related factors on outcomes.",

Where multiple variants initiate infection, recipient set point viral load (SpVL) and the rate of CD4\n              +\n              T cell decline may be elevated, but these findings remain inconsistent. Here, we summarised the evidence for this phenomenon, then tested whether previous studies possessed sufficient statistical power to reliably identify a true effect of multiple variant infection leading to higher SpVL. Next, we combined models of HIV-1 transmission, heritability and disease progression to understand whether available data suggest a faster CD4\n              +\n              T cell decline would be expected to associated with multiple variant infection, without an explicit dependency between the two. First, we found that most studies had insufficient power to identify a true significant difference, prompting an explanation for previous inconsistencies. Next, our model framework revealed we would not expect to observe a positive association between multiple variant infections and faster CD4\n              +\n              T cell decline, in the absence of an explicit dependency. Consequently, while empirical evidence may be consistent with a positive association between multiple variant infection and faster CD4\n              +\n              T cell decline, further investigation is required to establish a causal basis.",

    "abstract": "Introduction:\n              Contact tracing has the potential to control outbreaks without the need for stringent physical distancing policies, e.g. civil lockdowns. Unlike forward contact tracing, backward contact tracing identifies the source of newly detected cases. This approach is particularly valuable when there is high individual-level variation in the number of secondary transmissions (overdispersion).\n            \n            \n              Methods:\n              By using a simple branching process model, we explored the potential of combining backward contact tracing with more conventional forward contact tracing for control of COVID-19. We estimated the typical size of clusters that can be reached by backward tracing and simulated the incremental effectiveness of combining backward tracing with conventional forward tracing.\n            \n            \n              Results:\n              Across ranges of parameter values consistent with dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, backward tracing is expected to identify a primary case generating 3-10 times more infections than a randomly chosen case, typically increasing the proportion of subsequent cases averted by a factor of 2-3. The estimated number of cases averted by backward tracing became greater with a higher degree of overdispersion.\n            \n            \n              Conclusion:\n              Backward contact tracing can be an effective tool for outbreak control, especially in the presence of overdispersion as is observed with SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          A standard method in phylogenetic reconstruction for representing variation in substitution rates between sites in the genome is the discrete Gamma model (DGM). Relative rates are assumed to be distributed according to a discretised Gamma distribution, where the probabilities that a site is included in each class are equal. Here, we identify a serious bias in the branch lengths of reconstructed phylogenies when the DGM is used, with the magnitude of the effect varying with the number of sequences in the alignment. We demonstrate the existence of the bias in both simulated dataset and using real HIV-1 sequences; in both cases branch lengths are overestimated. We show that the alternative “FreeRate” model, which assumes no parametric distribution and allows the class probabilities to vary, is not subject to the issue. We further establish that the reason for the behaviour is the equal class probabilities, not the discretisation itself. We explore the mathematics of for the phenomenon, showing how maximum likelihood branch lengths under the DGM may differ from the true ones used to generate the tree, and that branch lengths will be overestimated where there is a long-tail of fast-evolving sites in the true rate distribution, which is the usual situation in real datasets. We recommend that the DGM be retired from general use. While FreeRate is an immediately available replacement, it is known to be difficult to fit, and thus there is scope for innovation in rate heterogeneity models.",

While some variants rapidly spread worldwide, other variants only persist nationally. There is a need for more fine-scale analysis to understand transmission dynamics at a country scale. For instance, the Mu variant of interest, also known as lineage B.1.621, was first detected in Colombia and was responsible for a large local wave but only a few sporadic cases elsewhere.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              To better understand the epidemiology of SARS-Cov-2 variants in Colombia, we used 14,049 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the 32 states of Colombia. We performed Bayesian phylodynamic analyses to estimate the time of variants’ introduction, their respective effective reproductive number, and effective population size, and the impact of disease control measures.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Here, we detect a total of 188 SARS-CoV-2 Pango lineages circulating in Colombia since the pandemic’s start. We show that the effective reproduction number oscillated drastically throughout the first two years of the pandemic, with Mu showing the highest transmissibility (Re and growth rate estimation).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Our results reinforce that genomic surveillance programs are essential for countries to make evidence-driven interventions toward the emergence and circulation of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n            \n              Background\n              Predicting bed occupancy for hospitalised patients with COVID-19 requires understanding of length of stay (LoS) in particular bed types. LoS can vary depending on the patient’s “bed pathway” - the sequence of transfers of individual patients between bed types during a hospital stay. In this study, we characterise these pathways, and their impact on predicted hospital bed occupancy.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We obtained data from University College Hospital (UCH) and the ISARIC4C COVID-19 Clinical Information Network (CO-CIN) on hospitalised patients with COVID-19 who required care in general ward or critical care (CC) beds to determine possible bed pathways and LoS. We developed a discrete-time model to examine the implications of using either bed pathways or only average LoS by bed type to forecast bed occupancy. We compared model-predicted bed occupancy to publicly available bed occupancy data on COVID-19 in England between March and August 2020.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              In both the UCH and CO-CIN datasets, 82% of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 only received care in general ward beds. We identified four other bed pathways, present in both datasets: “Ward, CC, Ward”, “Ward, CC”, “CC” and “CC, Ward”. Mean LoS varied by bed type, pathway, and dataset, between 1.78 and 13.53 days.\n              For UCH, we found that using bed pathways improved the accuracy of bed occupancy predictions, while only using an average LoS for each bed type underestimated true bed occupancy. However, using the CO-CIN LoS dataset we were not able to replicate past data on bed occupancy in England, suggesting regional LoS heterogeneities.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              We identified five bed pathways, with substantial variation in LoS by bed type, pathway, and geography. This might be caused by local differences in patient characteristics, clinical care strategies, or resource availability, and suggests that national LoS averages may not be appropriate for local forecasts of bed occupancy for COVID-19.\n            \n            \n              Trial registration\n              \n                The ISARIC WHO CCP-UK study\n                ISRCTN66726260\n                was retrospectively registered on 21/04/2020 and designated an Urgent Public Health Research Study by NIHR.",

The impact of public health interventions depend on the complex ecology governing serotype and antibiotic resistant strain dynamics, for which we currently lack mechanistic explanations. Ee evaluated whether multi-serotype transmission models of antibiotic resistant pneumococcal strains can recapitulate empirical resistance data, thus providing a plausible explanation for how antibiotic-sensitive and resistant strains coexist at intermediate frequencies, both between and within serotypes.\n          \n          \n            Methods\n            We extracted a global dataset of pneumococcal carriage prevalence in healthy, unvaccinated children by serotype and penicillin susceptibility from a previously-published systematic review. Next, we developed a suite of multi-serotype individual-based models that have previously been shown to plausibly explain coexistence in single serotype models, incorporating transmission and clearance rate differences between serotypes and serotype-specific immunity. Finally, we calibrated the suite of models to the relative serotype prevalence and overall resistance frequency drawn from the extracted dataset.\n          \n          \n            Results\n            Overall resistance frequency varied considerably between studies, but we found a positive association between frequency of a serotype and resistance frequency within that serotype, and a high degree of coexistence of sensitive and resistant strains within serotypes. Each individual-based model predicted different serotype-specific resistance frequencies, but combining models was necessary to capture all features of the empirical data.\n          \n          \n            Conclusions\n            Serotype-specific resistance patterns may give important clues to understand fundamental antibiotic resistance epidemiology. We show that combining multiple independently plausible mechanisms can capture resistant pneumococcal carriage, but additional data are needed to determine the strength of these individual mechanisms within these combinations.",

    "abstract": "Background\n              Measles outbreaks are still routine, even in countries where vaccination coverage exceeds the guideline of 95%. Therefore, achieving ambitions for measles eradication will require understanding of how unvaccinated children interact with others who are unvaccinated. It is well established that schools and homes are key settings for both clustering of unvaccinated children and for transmission of infection. In this study, we evaluate the potential for contacts between unvaccinated children in these contexts to facilitate measles outbreaks with a focus on the Netherlands, where large outbreaks have been observed periodically since the introduction of mumps, measles and rubella (MMR).\n            \n            \n              Methods and findings\n              We created a network of all primary and secondary schools in the Netherlands based on the total number of household pairs between each school. A household pair are siblings from the same household who attend a different school. We parameterised the network with individual level administrative school and household data provided by the Dutch Ministry for Education and estimates of school level uptake of the MMR vaccine. We analysed the network to establish the relative strength of contact between schools and found that schools associated with low vaccine uptake are highly connected, aided by a differentiated school system in the Netherlands (Coleman homophily index (CHI) = 0.63). We simulated measles outbreaks on the network and evaluated the model against empirical measles data per postcode area from a large outbreak in 2013 (2,766 cases). We found that the network-based model could reproduce the observed size and spatial distribution of the historic outbreak much more clearly than the alternative models, with a case weighted receiver operating characteristic (ROC) sensitivity of 0.94, compared to 0.17 and 0.26 for models that do not account for specific network structure or school-level vaccine uptake, respectively. The key limitation of our framework is that it neglects transmission routes outside of school and household contexts.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Our framework indicates that clustering of unvaccinated children in primary schools connected by unvaccinated children in related secondary schools lead to large, connected clusters of unvaccinated children. Using our approach, we could explain historical outbreaks on a spatial level. Our framework could be further developed to aid future outbreak response.",

    "abstract": "Despite implementing no lockdowns and having a large elderly population, Japan had a low mortality rate due to COVID-19 compared to Europe and North America. The extent to which policies impacted person-to-person contact remains unclear. In this study, we examined changes in contact patterns and their association with behaviors and governmental recommendations in Japan during the pandemic. Ten social contact surveys were conducted between 2021 and 2023 reaching over 1500 participants per survey in Osaka and Fukuoka prefectures where governmental recommendations were first implemented due to high COVID-19 incidence. Their contact patterns were assessed through their demographic characteristics, COVID-19 vaccination status, and individual disease mitigation measures. Generalized linear models were used to identify factors associated with increased contacts. The mean number of contacts during the pandemic declined by at least 49.8% (8.2 weekday contacts and 6.0 weekend contacts per individual, adjusted by age and sex) compared to a study conducted prior to 2020. Weekdays, occupation, larger household sizes, and mask wearing were associated with a higher number of contacts. The frequency and duration of contacts were negatively associated with the issuance of COVID-19 governmental measures, yet the relative change in contacts was not as prominent as pre- and post-lockdown situations in the United Kingdom. There was a gradual increase in contacts with time and less strict public health recommendations. Yet, contacts that did not increase with uptake of COVID-19 vaccination and continuous mask wearing depict cautious behavior across the survey population during the pandemic and into 2023. These results are in contrast with European countries where contacts largely increased among vaccinated individuals compared to the non-vaccinated. Social contacts are country and context specific, highlighting the need for data collection across different communities.",
